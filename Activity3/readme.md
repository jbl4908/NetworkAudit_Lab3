To use the script, first execute it.
From there you will be prompted for an ip address or range

You can thus input your ip as such:
1.) 10.10.10.10
2.) 10.10.10.10-10.10.10.20
3.) 10.10.10.0/24

After the input, it will take a bit to scan each ip address.
After the scan is complete, it will output all ip addresses that are up.
